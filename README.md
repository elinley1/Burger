* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, they have the choice of devouring it immediately, or holding off until later.

* If the user selects 'Devour' the the burger will be submitted under the "Some burgers you devoured." section of the page.

* Each burger in the "Some burgers to devour." section also has a `Let's Eat!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the "Devoured" section of the page.
